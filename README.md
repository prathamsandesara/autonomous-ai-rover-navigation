Where:
- `g(n)` is the cumulative terrain cost from the start
- `h(n)` is the heuristic estimate to the goal

## 🔄 Heuristics Implemented

| Heuristic | Description | Behavior |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Manhattan | Grid-based distance | Stable and optimal |
| Euclidean | Straight-line estimate | Smooth convergence |
| Squared Manhattan | Aggressive heuristic | Faster but costlier |
| Logarithmic | Slow-growing heuristic | Safer exploration |

A **Compare Heuristics** mode allows visual comparison of paths generated by each heuristic.

## ⚡ Battery-Aware Planning

- The rover continuously monitors its battery level
- If the goal is unreachable with current battery:
  - A* is re-run toward reachable recharge stations
  - The station closest to the final goal is selected
- Recharge behavior overrides normal goal planning

---

## ⚠️ Hazard-Aware Navigation

- Discovered hazards are stored in memory
- Trap and hazardous tiles become **dynamic obstacles**
- Immediate backtracking is triggered when danger is detected
- Known hazards are skipped during node expansion

This allows the rover to **learn from past mistakes**.

## 🤖 Hybrid AI Architecture

### Reflex Layer (High Priority)
- Low battery override
- Trap and hazard detection
- Emergency backtracking
- Recharge-in-place behavior

### Deliberative Layer
- A* path planning
- Heuristic selection
- Long-term goal optimization

> Safety always overrides planning decisions.

## 🖥️ Graphical User Interface (Tkinter)

The GUI provides:
- Color-coded terrain visualization
- Real-time rover movement
- Live battery status with progress bar
- Agent decision logs and warnings
- Simulation controls (Pause, Resume, Step Once)
- Speed adjustment slider
- Heuristic comparison visualization

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tkinter (included with most Python installations)

### Run the Simulation
```bash
python src/main.py
