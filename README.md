# 🚀 Autonomous AI Planetary Rover Navigation Agent

An **autonomous artificial intelligence rover** that navigates a hazardous planetary terrain using **A\*** search, **multiple heuristics**, and **reactive survival behaviors**.  
The system combines **deliberative planning** with **real-time reflex actions** to safely reach goals under uncertainty.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates an intelligent planetary rover operating on a **20×20 grid-based environment** containing:

- Multiple terrain types with different traversal costs  
- Hazards, traps, cliffs, and impassable regions  
- Limited battery capacity  
- Recharge stations  

The rover dynamically plans **optimal and safe paths** while reacting to hazards, low battery levels, and environmental changes.

## 🧠 AI Concepts Used

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- A* Search Algorithm
- Heuristic Search
- Autonomous Agents
- Deliberative + Reactive Architecture
- State Space Search
- Constraint-Based Decision Making

## 🗺️ Terrain & Cost Modeling

Each grid cell is modeled as a **state** with:
- Position `(x, y)`
- Terrain type
- Movement cost
- Hazard / trap status
- Passability

### Terrain Costs

| Terrain Type | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Flat | 5 |
| Sandy | 10 |
| Trap | 20 |
| Hazardous | 25 |
| Cliff / Rock | Impassable |

---

## 🔍 A* Search Algorithm

The rover plans paths using the standard A* evaluation function:

f(n) = g(n) + h(n) 
Where:
- `g(n)` is the cumulative terrain cost from the start
- `h(n)` is the heuristic estimate to the goal

---

## 🔄 Heuristics Implemented

| Heuristic | Description | Behavior |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Manhattan | Grid-based distance | Stable and optimal |
| Euclidean | Straight-line estimate | Smooth convergence |
| Squared Manhattan | Aggressive heuristic | Faster but costlier |
| Logarithmic | Slow-growing heuristic | Safer exploration |

A **Compare Heuristics** mode allows visual comparison of paths generated by each heuristic.

## ⚡ Battery-Aware Planning

- The rover continuously monitors its battery level
- If the goal is unreachable with current battery:
  - A* is re-run toward reachable recharge stations
  - The station closest to the final goal is selected
- Recharge behavior overrides normal goal planning

---

## ⚠️ Hazard-Aware Navigation

- Discovered hazards are stored in memory
- Trap and hazardous tiles become **dynamic obstacles**
- Immediate backtracking is triggered when danger is detected
- Known hazards are skipped during node expansion

This allows the rover to **learn from past mistakes**.

## 🤖 Hybrid AI Architecture

### Reflex Layer (High Priority)
- Low battery override
- Trap and hazard detection
- Emergency backtracking
- Recharge-in-place behavior

### Deliberative Layer
- A* path planning
- Heuristic selection
- Long-term goal optimization

> Safety always overrides planning decisions.

The GUI provides:
- Color-coded terrain visualization
- Real-time rover movement
- Live battery status with progress bar
- Agent decision logs and warnings
- Simulation controls (Pause, Resume, Step Once)
- Speed adjustment slider
- Heuristic comparison visualization
